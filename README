The configuration files for NGinx to have SSI and mimetypes set up.

Basically, it's the minimal install required for designers to use SSI.
It has been tested on a Windows machine and assumes that the files are
in c:/projects/html but you can change this by editing the file.

The file should appear in the nginx subdirectory

  conf

You will want to rename the original configuration file most likely.
